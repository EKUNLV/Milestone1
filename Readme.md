The inspiration of this game was "House of Danger" a choose your own adventure board game that is kinda spooky. 
Each scenario has a set of choices that each have decision/consequence's. Choose your own path! It is very basic and short.
I used forms and radio buttons which I haven't used before, I watched a tutorial on how to add them to my project because the "if/if else" statements I was trying to use before honestly became too much. 
Some outstanding bugs/unfinished stuff is, The background music seems to only start once you hit the reset button. I also tried to add a deathCounter button, I left some of my code in there trying to add it. Honestly spent 4 hours looking it up and how I can implement it before I realized my reset button refreshes the page and would in fact reset the deathCounter lol
